Instructions for Getting VPN access for non Emory students or residents:

1. Contact your sponosoring faculty for your PIN.
2. Call 404-727-7777 and select option 2 for campus network access. You’ll have to provide your PINs to the agent and then your VPN access will be enabled.
3. Visit vpn.emory.edu and login with your netID and password, which you should have received via email. The PIN above is NOT part of the login process. You’ll need the f5 client linked on the page.
4. Make sure you have your OS firewall enabled, and you may need an antivirus client. Please contact your faculty with any troubleshooting issues. 

For future access, Please use the **BIG-IP client** which has better stability and is available here [https://it.emory.edu/vpntools/](https://it.emory.edu/vpntools/)
